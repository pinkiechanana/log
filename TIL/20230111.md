### **기타:**
**React**
- `useEffect` : sets side effect when rendered
takes a function and takes a second parameter to tell when to set effect.(in a Array)
```
const [ddong, setDdong] = useState('post')

setEffect(() => {
  console.log('rendered')
}, [ddong])
```
- if you don't put anything as the second parameter(even the array bracket), it will take effect for EVERY render

- if you put an empty array, it will only run once on mount(when the page first loads), so it will run once and then even if you refresh like a billion times, it won't take effect

- you can return a function within the `useEffect` to "clean up" the previous code for the return statement will be run first so that the previous function will be "cleaned up" before the next function runs



**Redux**
- `state`들을 하나에 보관/관리용
